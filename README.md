# Machine Learning Assignments 📚🤖

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Assignments** repository!  
This is where I document my journey through the world of ML — one assignment at a time.  
Each file here represents a step forward in understanding the theory, math, and code that power intelligent systems.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repo contains my solutions, notes, and experiments for various machine learning assignments.  
They might range from basic data preprocessing tasks to training complex models, depending on the course/module.

The goal is not just to finish the assignments, but to **learn deeply** and **build a personal reference library** I can come back to.
